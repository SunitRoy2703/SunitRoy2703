### About me 

      You have to have some problem, that you want to solve.
-Steve Jobs
To be honest programming isn't a exciting job, you are just literally telling the computer what to do. The thing what actually excites me is that it gives you a superpower to help people, make their life easy , make products what other people can use, Because the power of computer is limitless.
